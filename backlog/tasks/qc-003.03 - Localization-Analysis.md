## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Analyze what changes are needed to make QualCoder v2 fully localizable. This includes auditing current strings, evaluating i18n frameworks for PyQt6, and designing the translation workflow.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Rationale

QualCoder is used by researchers worldwide. Supporting multiple languages will:
- Expand accessibility to non-English speakers
- Build on QualCoder v1's existing translation community
- Ensure UI strings are properly externalized from the start

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

### String Audit
- [ ] #1 Inventory all user-facing strings in presentation layer
- [ ] #2 Identify strings in domain layer (error messages, validation)
- [ ] #3 Categorize by bounded context (Coding, Sources, Cases, etc.)
- [ ] #4 Check QualCoder v1 for existing translations to leverage

### Framework Evaluation
- [ ] #5 Evaluate Qt Linguist (`.ts`/`.qm`) for PyQt6
- [ ] #6 Evaluate GNU gettext (`.po`/`.mo`) as alternative
- [ ] #7 Document pros/cons of each approach
- [ ] #8 Recommend framework with rationale

### Architecture Design
- [ ] #9 Define where translation loading happens (Infrastructure layer)
- [ ] #10 Design locale preference storage in user settings
- [ ] #11 Determine if runtime language switching is needed
- [ ] #12 Plan for RTL (right-to-left) language support

### Translation Workflow
- [ ] #13 Research contribution platforms (Weblate, Crowdin, GitHub)
- [ ] #14 Define workflow: extract → translate → review → build
- [ ] #15 Identify initial target languages based on user demand

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

**This is an analysis task** - deliverables are documentation and recommendations, not code.

**Key questions to answer:**
- What does QualCoder v1 use? Can we reuse translations?
- Which languages are most requested?
- Should language switch require restart?

**Special considerations:**
- Pluralization rules differ by language
- String interpolation should use named placeholders
- German/Finnish text can be 30% longer than English
- CJK fonts need consideration

## Downstream Tasks

This analysis will inform:
- QC-003.04 - Localization Infrastructure (implementation)
- All presentation layer tasks (string externalization)

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Verify string audit is comprehensive
- [ ] Validate framework recommendation with prototype
