## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
CollaborationSignalBridge: emit Qt signals for coder events, merge events, comparison results. Enable real-time UI updates.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
### CollaborationSignalBridge Class (QObject)
- [ ] #1 `CollaborationSignalBridge(QObject)` - bridges Collaboration events to Qt
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `CollaborationSignalBridge.instance()`

### Qt Signals (PyQt6 pyqtSignal)
- [ ] #3 `coder_created = pyqtSignal(object)` - new coder (human or AI)
- [ ] #4 `coder_renamed = pyqtSignal(object)` - coder name changed
- [ ] #5 `coder_deleted = pyqtSignal(object)` - coder removed
- [ ] #6 `merge_started = pyqtSignal(object)` - merge operation began
- [ ] #7 `conflict_detected = pyqtSignal(object)` - merge conflict found
- [ ] #8 `merge_completed = pyqtSignal(object)` - merge finished
- [ ] #9 `comparison_calculated = pyqtSignal(object)` - Kappa calculated
- [ ] #10 `ai_code_promoted = pyqtSignal(object)` - AI coding transferred to human
- [ ] #11 `ai_visibility_changed = pyqtSignal(object)` - AI coding visibility toggled

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #12 Subscribe to all Collaboration context events on EventBus
- [ ] #13 `_on_collaboration_event(event)` dispatcher

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #14 Use `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection`
- [ ] #15 AI coder operations from MCP thread safely emit to main thread

### Architecture
- [ ] #16 Follows same pattern as other Signal Bridges (Coding, Source, Case, Agent)
- [ ] #17 UI connects to bridge for real-time coder/merge/comparison updates
