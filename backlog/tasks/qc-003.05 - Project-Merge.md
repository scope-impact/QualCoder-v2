## Description

Merge two separate QualCoder projects (.qda files) into one. Different from code merging (QC-024.02) which merges codes within a project.

## Original QualCoder Reference

- Module: `merge_projects.py`
- Features: Import codes, files, cases from another project

## Acceptance Criteria

### Merge Selection
- [ ] #1 Select source project to merge from
- [ ] #2 Choose what to merge (codes, files, cases, journals)
- [ ] #3 Preview changes before applying

### Merge Strategies
- [ ] #4 Codes: Merge by name (combine) or add as new
- [ ] #5 Files: Skip duplicates, rename, or replace
- [ ] #6 Cases: Merge by name or add as new
- [ ] #7 Preserve original coder attribution

### Conflict Resolution
- [ ] #8 Detect duplicate code names
- [ ] #9 Detect duplicate file names
- [ ] #10 User choice for each conflict

### Merge Report
- [ ] #11 List items merged
- [ ] #12 List conflicts resolved
- [ ] #13 List items skipped

## Implementation

- `src/application/project/merge_projects.py`
- `src/presentation/dialogs/merge_project_dialog.py`

## Note

Agent should NOT perform project merges autonomously (destructive operation).
