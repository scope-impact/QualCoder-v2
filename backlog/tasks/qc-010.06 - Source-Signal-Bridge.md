## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
SourceSignalBridge: Convert domain events to Qt signals. Enable UI observation of source changes from both UI and Agent. Thread-safe emission.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
### SourceSignalBridge Class (QObject)
- [ ] #1 `SourceSignalBridge(QObject)` - bridges Source domain events to Qt signals
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `SourceSignalBridge.instance()`

### Qt Signals (PyQt6 pyqtSignal)
- [ ] #3 `source_imported = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SourceImported event
- [ ] #4 `source_renamed = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SourceRenamed event
- [ ] #5 `source_deleted = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SourceDeleted event
- [ ] #6 `source_memo_updated = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SourceMemoUpdated event
- [ ] #7 `speakers_detected = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SpeakersDetected event
- [ ] #8 `source_case_linked = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SourceCaseLinked event
- [ ] #9 `survey_imported = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits SurveyImported event

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #10 Subscribe to all Source context events on EventBus at initialization
- [ ] #11 Event handler maps event type → corresponding Qt signal emission
- [ ] #12 `_on_domain_event(event: DomainEvent)` dispatcher method

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #13 Use `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` for cross-thread emission
- [ ] #14 Agent operations (from MCP thread) safely emit to Qt main thread
- [ ] #15 UI operations (from main thread) emit directly

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] #16 Bridge is in Application layer - decouples UI from Event Bus
- [ ] #17 UI widgets connect to bridge signals, not directly to EventBus
- [ ] #18 Follows same pattern as CodingSignalBridge (QC-006.04)
