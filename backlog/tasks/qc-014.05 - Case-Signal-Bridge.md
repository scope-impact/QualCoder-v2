## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
CaseSignalBridge: Convert domain events to Qt signals. Enable UI observation of case changes from both UI and Agent. Thread-safe emission.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
### CaseSignalBridge Class (QObject)
- [ ] #1 `CaseSignalBridge(QObject)` - bridges Case domain events to Qt signals
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `CaseSignalBridge.instance()`

### Qt Signals (PyQt6 pyqtSignal)
- [ ] #3 `case_created = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits CaseCreated event
- [ ] #4 `case_renamed = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits CaseRenamed event
- [ ] #5 `case_deleted = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits CaseDeleted event
- [ ] #6 `case_memo_updated = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits CaseMemoUpdated event
- [ ] #7 `member_added = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits CaseMemberAdded event
- [ ] #8 `member_removed = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits CaseMemberRemoved event
- [ ] #9 `attribute_type_changed = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits attribute type events
- [ ] #10 `attribute_value_changed = pyqtSignal(object)` - emits attribute value events

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #11 Subscribe to all Case context events on EventBus at initialization
- [ ] #12 Event handler maps event type → corresponding Qt signal
- [ ] #13 `_on_domain_event(event: DomainEvent)` dispatcher

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #14 Use `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` for cross-thread emission
- [ ] #15 Agent operations safely emit to Qt main thread

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] #16 Follows same pattern as CodingSignalBridge and SourceSignalBridge
- [ ] #17 UI widgets connect to bridge signals, not directly to EventBus
