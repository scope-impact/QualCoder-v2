## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
AgentSignalBridge: emit Qt signals for agent events - suggestion_received, suggestion_approved/rejected, activity_logged, statistics_updated.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
### AgentSignalBridge Class (QObject)
- [ ] #1 `AgentSignalBridge(QObject)` - bridges agent events to Qt signals
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `AgentSignalBridge.instance()`

### Qt Signals (PyQt6 pyqtSignal)
- [ ] #3 `suggestion_received = pyqtSignal(object)` - new suggestion queued
- [ ] #4 `suggestion_approved = pyqtSignal(object)` - suggestion approved
- [ ] #5 `suggestion_rejected = pyqtSignal(object)` - suggestion rejected
- [ ] #6 `activity_logged = pyqtSignal(object)` - agent action logged
- [ ] #7 `statistics_updated = pyqtSignal(object)` - stats changed
- [ ] #8 `agent_connected = pyqtSignal(object)` - new agent session started
- [ ] #9 `agent_disconnected = pyqtSignal(object)` - agent session ended
- [ ] #10 `trust_level_changed = pyqtSignal(object)` - trust level modified

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #11 Subscribe to all agent-related events on EventBus
- [ ] #12 `_on_agent_event(event)` dispatcher maps event type → signal

### Thread Safety (CRITICAL)
- [ ] #13 Agent runs in MCP thread, UI in main thread
- [ ] #14 Use `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection`
- [ ] #15 All signal emissions are thread-safe

### Architecture
- [ ] #16 Follows same pattern as CodingSignalBridge, SourceSignalBridge, CaseSignalBridge
- [ ] #17 UI widgets connect to bridge signals for agent activity updates
