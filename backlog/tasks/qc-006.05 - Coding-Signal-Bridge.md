## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Bridge between domain events and UI signals for the Coding context. Enables UI to observe domain changes from both UI and Agent actions.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

### CodingSignalBridge Class
- [ ] #1 Extends BaseSignalBridge from QC-003.01
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `CodingSignalBridge.instance()`

### UI Signals
- [ ] #3 `code_created` signal - emits CodeCreated payload
- [ ] #4 `code_renamed` signal - emits CodeRenamed payload
- [ ] #5 `code_deleted` signal - emits CodeDeleted payload
- [ ] #6 `code_color_changed` signal - emits CodeColorChanged payload
- [ ] #7 `segment_coded` signal - emits SegmentCoded payload
- [ ] #8 `segment_uncoded` signal - emits SegmentUncoded payload
- [ ] #9 `category_created` signal - emits CategoryCreated payload
- [ ] #10 `category_deleted` signal - emits CategoryDeleted payload

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #11 Subscribe to all Coding context events on EventBus
- [ ] #12 Event handler maps event type → corresponding UI signal emission
- [ ] #13 Dispatcher method routes domain events to converters

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #14 Thread-safe emission (inherits from BaseSignalBridge)
- [ ] #15 Agent operations (from background thread) safely emit to UI thread
- [ ] #16 UI operations (from UI thread) emit directly

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] #17 Bridge is in Application layer - decouples UI from Event Bus
- [ ] #18 UI widgets connect to bridge signals, not directly to EventBus
- [ ] #19 Both UI actions and Agent actions trigger same domain events → same signals

## Implementation Notes

**For PyQt6:**
- Inherits from `QObject` via BaseSignalBridge
- Signals declared as `pyqtSignal(object)`
- Uses `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` (via base class)
