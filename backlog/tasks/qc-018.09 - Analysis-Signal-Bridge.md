## Description

Bridge between domain events and UI signals for the Analysis context. Enables UI to observe report generation and export events.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AnalysisSignalBridge Class
- [ ] #1 Extends BaseSignalBridge from QC-003.01
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `AnalysisSignalBridge.instance()`

### UI Signals
- [ ] #3 `report_generated` signal - emits ReportGenerated payload
- [ ] #4 `report_exported` signal - emits ReportExported payload
- [ ] #5 `query_executed` signal - emits QueryExecuted payload
- [ ] #6 `chart_generated` signal - emits ChartGenerated payload
- [ ] #7 `graph_generated` signal - emits GraphGenerated payload
- [ ] #8 `wordcloud_generated` signal - emits WordCloudGenerated payload
- [ ] #9 `journal_entry_created` signal - emits JournalEntryCreated payload
- [ ] #10 `journal_entry_updated` signal - emits JournalEntryUpdated payload

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #11 Subscribe to all Analysis context events on EventBus
- [ ] #12 Event handler maps event type → corresponding UI signal emission

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #13 Thread-safe emission (inherits from BaseSignalBridge)
- [ ] #14 Long-running report generation (background) safely emits to UI
