## Description

As a Researcher, I want to version control my project database so that I can track changes over time, rollback mistakes, and collaborate with other coders.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #1 I can initialize version control for my project
- [ ] #2 I can create a snapshot with a descriptive message
- [ ] #3 I can view the history of all snapshots
- [ ] #4 I can see what changed between two snapshots
- [ ] #5 I can restore my project to a previous snapshot
- [ ] #6 I can create branches for different analysis approaches
- [ ] #7 I can merge changes from different branches
