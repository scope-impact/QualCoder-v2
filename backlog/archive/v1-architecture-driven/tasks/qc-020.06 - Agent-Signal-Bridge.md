## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Bridge between agent events and UI signals. Emit signals for suggestion_received, suggestion_approved/rejected, activity_logged, statistics_updated.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

### AgentSignalBridge Class
- [ ] #1 Extends BaseSignalBridge from QC-003.01
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `AgentSignalBridge.instance()`

### UI Signals
- [ ] #3 `suggestion_received` signal - new suggestion queued
- [ ] #4 `suggestion_approved` signal - suggestion approved
- [ ] #5 `suggestion_rejected` signal - suggestion rejected
- [ ] #6 `activity_logged` signal - agent action logged
- [ ] #7 `statistics_updated` signal - stats changed
- [ ] #8 `agent_connected` signal - new agent session started
- [ ] #9 `agent_disconnected` signal - agent session ended
- [ ] #10 `trust_level_changed` signal - trust level modified

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #11 Subscribe to all agent-related events on EventBus
- [ ] #12 Dispatcher maps event type → signal

### Thread Safety (CRITICAL)
- [ ] #13 Agent runs in background thread, UI in main thread
- [ ] #14 Thread-safe emission (inherits from BaseSignalBridge)
- [ ] #15 All signal emissions are thread-safe

### Architecture
- [ ] #16 Follows same pattern as other Signal Bridges (Coding, Source, Case)
- [ ] #17 UI widgets connect to bridge signals for agent activity updates

## Implementation Notes

**For PyQt6:**
- Inherits from `QObject` via BaseSignalBridge
- Signals declared as `pyqtSignal(object)`
- Uses `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` (via base class)
