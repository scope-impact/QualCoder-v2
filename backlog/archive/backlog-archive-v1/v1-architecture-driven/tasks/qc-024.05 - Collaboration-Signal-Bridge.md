## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Bridge between collaboration events and UI signals. Emit signals for coder events, merge events, comparison results. Enable real-time UI updates.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

### CollaborationSignalBridge Class
- [ ] #1 Extends BaseSignalBridge from QC-003.01
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `CollaborationSignalBridge.instance()`

### UI Signals
- [ ] #3 `coder_created` signal - new coder (human or AI)
- [ ] #4 `coder_renamed` signal - coder name changed
- [ ] #5 `coder_deleted` signal - coder removed
- [ ] #6 `merge_started` signal - merge operation began
- [ ] #7 `conflict_detected` signal - merge conflict found
- [ ] #8 `merge_completed` signal - merge finished
- [ ] #9 `comparison_calculated` signal - Kappa calculated
- [ ] #10 `ai_code_promoted` signal - AI coding transferred to human
- [ ] #11 `ai_visibility_changed` signal - AI coding visibility toggled

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #12 Subscribe to all Collaboration context events on EventBus
- [ ] #13 Dispatcher routes events to appropriate signals

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #14 Thread-safe emission (inherits from BaseSignalBridge)
- [ ] #15 AI coder operations from background thread safely emit to UI thread

### Architecture
- [ ] #16 Follows same pattern as other Signal Bridges (Coding, Source, Case, Agent)
- [ ] #17 UI connects to bridge for real-time coder/merge/comparison updates

## Implementation Notes

**For PyQt6:**
- Inherits from `QObject` via BaseSignalBridge
- Signals declared as `pyqtSignal(object)`
- Uses `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` (via base class)
