## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Bridge between domain events and UI signals for the Case context. Enable UI observation of case changes from both UI and Agent. Thread-safe emission.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

### CaseSignalBridge Class
- [ ] #1 Extends BaseSignalBridge from QC-003.01
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `CaseSignalBridge.instance()`

### UI Signals
- [ ] #3 `case_created` signal - emits CaseCreated payload
- [ ] #4 `case_renamed` signal - emits CaseRenamed payload
- [ ] #5 `case_deleted` signal - emits CaseDeleted payload
- [ ] #6 `case_memo_updated` signal - emits CaseMemoUpdated payload
- [ ] #7 `member_added` signal - emits CaseMemberAdded payload
- [ ] #8 `member_removed` signal - emits CaseMemberRemoved payload
- [ ] #9 `attribute_type_changed` signal - emits attribute type payload
- [ ] #10 `attribute_value_changed` signal - emits attribute value payload

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #11 Subscribe to all Case context events on EventBus at initialization
- [ ] #12 Event handler maps event type → corresponding UI signal
- [ ] #13 Dispatcher method routes domain events to converters

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #14 Thread-safe emission (inherits from BaseSignalBridge)
- [ ] #15 Agent operations (from background thread) safely emit to UI thread

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] #16 Follows same pattern as CodingSignalBridge and SourceSignalBridge
- [ ] #17 UI widgets connect to bridge signals, not directly to EventBus

## Implementation Notes

**For PyQt6:**
- Inherits from `QObject` via BaseSignalBridge
- Signals declared as `pyqtSignal(object)`
- Uses `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` (via base class)
