## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Bridge between domain events and UI signals for the Source context. Enable UI observation of source changes from both UI and Agent. Thread-safe emission.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

### SourceSignalBridge Class
- [ ] #1 Extends BaseSignalBridge from QC-003.01
- [ ] #2 Singleton instance accessible via `SourceSignalBridge.instance()`

### UI Signals
- [ ] #3 `source_imported` signal - emits SourceImported payload
- [ ] #4 `source_renamed` signal - emits SourceRenamed payload
- [ ] #5 `source_deleted` signal - emits SourceDeleted payload
- [ ] #6 `source_memo_updated` signal - emits SourceMemoUpdated payload
- [ ] #7 `speakers_detected` signal - emits SpeakersDetected payload
- [ ] #8 `source_case_linked` signal - emits SourceCaseLinked payload
- [ ] #9 `survey_imported` signal - emits SurveyImported payload

### Event Bus Subscription
- [ ] #10 Subscribe to all Source context events on EventBus at initialization
- [ ] #11 Event handler maps event type → corresponding UI signal emission
- [ ] #12 Dispatcher method routes domain events to converters

### Thread Safety
- [ ] #13 Thread-safe emission (inherits from BaseSignalBridge)
- [ ] #14 Agent operations (from background thread) safely emit to UI thread
- [ ] #15 UI operations (from UI thread) emit directly

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] #16 Bridge is in Application layer - decouples UI from Event Bus
- [ ] #17 UI widgets connect to bridge signals, not directly to EventBus
- [ ] #18 Follows same pattern as CodingSignalBridge (QC-006.04)

## Implementation Notes

**For PyQt6:**
- Inherits from `QObject` via BaseSignalBridge
- Signals declared as `pyqtSignal(object)`
- Uses `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.QueuedConnection` (via base class)
