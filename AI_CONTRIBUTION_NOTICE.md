# AI-Assisted Development Notice

This project uses AI coding assistants (Claude Code) during development. Contributors and users should be aware of the following legal considerations regarding AI-generated code and the LGPL-3.0 license.

## Copyright Ownership Uncertainty

- U.S. Copyright Office maintains that purely AI-generated content cannot receive copyright protection
- LGPL requires contributors to have rights to license their contributions
- The legal status of AI-generated code under copyleft licenses remains untested in courts

## Training Data Considerations

- AI models are trained on large datasets that may include GPL/LGPL-licensed code
- Whether AI outputs inherit licenses from training data is legally unresolved
- Courts have not definitively ruled on license "contamination" from AI-generated code

## Attribution Challenges

- LGPL requires proper attribution for contributions
- AI-generated code has no clear original human author
- The "Co-Authored-By: Claude" convention is not legally established

## Contribution Guidelines

To mitigate legal risks when contributing AI-assisted code:

1. **Review all AI-generated code** before committing - do not blindly accept suggestions
2. **Make meaningful modifications** to AI suggestions to establish human authorship
3. **Document AI assistance** transparently in commit messages
4. **Understand that legal landscape is evolving** - these guidelines may change

## Anthropic's Terms

Per [Anthropic's Commercial Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/news/expanded-legal-protections-api-improvements):

- API/commercial users retain ownership of outputs
